# 🔍 Web Research AI Agent — n8n + Exa MCP

A conversational AI agent built in n8n that uses **Exa's MCP server** to perform live web search and page fetching. Demonstrates external MCP integration with an n8n AI Agent node using HTTP Streamable transport.

## 🧠 What is Exa? (Simple Explanation)

Think of **Google** as a search engine built for humans — it shows you links and snippets so *you* can read and decide.

**Exa** is a search engine built for **AI agents** — it returns clean, structured content that an AI can directly read, understand, and use. No ads. No noise. Just the actual information.

| | Google | Exa |
|---|---|---|
| Built for | Humans | AI agents |
| Returns | Links + snippets | Full readable content |
| How it searches | Keyword matching | Meaning-based (neural search) |
| Best used by | You, in a browser | Your AI agent, inside a workflow |

### When should your agent use Exa?

| Situation | Use Exa? |
|---|---|
| Agent needs to find current news or recent events | ✅ Yes |
| Agent needs to read the full content of a webpage | ✅ Yes |
| Agent needs to research a topic before generating output | ✅ Yes |
| Agent already has all the information in its context | ❌ No |
| You need real-time stock prices or live database queries | ❌ No — use a dedicated API |

> **One-line rule for individuals:** If your agent needs to *know something it wasn't trained on*, give it Exa.

## 📌 What This Workflow Does

- Accepts a user message via the **Chat Trigger**
- Routes it to an **AI Agent** (OpenRouter/Gemini) with memory
- The agent autonomously decides when to call Exa's MCP tools:
  - `web_search_exa` — searches the live web for any query
  - `web_fetch_exa` — fetches and reads a full webpage as markdown
- Returns a structured, cited response back to the user

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Exa API key → <a href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" target="_blank">Get it here</a>

> **Free tier note:** Exa offers a free plan. Individuals can test without a paid account but will hit rate limits under heavy usage.

---

### 2. Node Configuration

#### Chat Trigger
- Default settings — no changes needed

#### OpenRouter Chat Model
- Connect your OpenRouter API credential
- Recommended model: `google/gemini-flash-1.5` (free) or any model of your choice

#### Simple Memory
- Default settings — stores conversation history within a session

#### MCP Client (Exa)

| Parameter          | Value                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Endpoint           | `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp`    |
| Server Transport   | HTTP Streamable              |
| Authentication     | Header Auth                  |
| Tools to Include   | All                          |

**Header Auth Credential setup:**

| Field         | Value               |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Header Name   | `x-api-key`         |
| Header Value  | `your_exa_api_key`  |

### 3. AI Agent — System Message

Paste this into the AI Agent node's **System Message** field:

```
You are a research assistant with access to Exa's web search tools.

When the user asks a question:
- Use web_search_exa for finding current information, news, or general research
- Use web_fetch_exa when the user provides a specific URL and wants its content
- Always cite where the information came from
- Keep responses concise and structured — use bullet points for lists, bold for key takeaways
- If a search returns irrelevant results, refine and search again before responding

Do not make up information. If you cannot find something, say so clearly.
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Where it shows up |
|---|---|
| External MCP over HTTP | MCP Client node using SSE/Streamable HTTP (not stdio) |
| Agent tool autonomy | Agent decides when to call `web_search_exa` vs `web_fetch_exa` |
| Multi-tool chaining | Advanced prompts trigger both tools in a single agent run |
| Conversation memory | Simple Memory node retains context across turns |

---

## 📂 Available Exa MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `web_search_exa` | Search the live web for any topic |
| `web_fetch_exa` | Read full page content from a URL as clean markdown |
| `web_search_advanced_exa` | Advanced search with filters, date ranges, domain restrictions *(optional)* |

To enable advanced search, update the endpoint:
```
https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=web_search_exa,web_fetch_exa,web_search_advanced_exa
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Tools not appearing after Execute Step | Check that Header Auth credential is correctly saved with `x-api-key` |
| 429 Rate Limit error | Add your Exa API key — free plan has low limits |
| Agent not using MCP tools | Ensure the MCP Client is connected to the **Tool** port (not the main input) |
| Empty search results | Try rephrasing the query — Exa uses neural search, so natural language works better than keywords |
